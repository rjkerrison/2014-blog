	Hi, I'm Robin James Kerrison. Welcome to my blog. You probably want to where it grew up, what its lousy childhood was like and all that David Copperblog kind of stuff, which is fortunate as I feel like going into it.

	I started this blog foremost as a place to keep a track of the many pies in which my fingers are ruining someone's otherwise perfectly lovely pie. I've since learnt a lot about third party web tools like Jekyll, Github and Travis.

	I first started playing around with websites with my friend Bobby nearly nine years ago; back then, XHTML 1.1 was novel and CSS had barely broken out of 2. Now HTML5 has blown XHTML out of the water, and CSS has finally started being useful for people wanting to make pretty websites instead of scientific reports with hypertext.
