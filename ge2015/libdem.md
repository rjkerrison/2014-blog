Prior to the current government, the Liberal Democrats were seen by many as the only real alternative
to a ping-pong system of Parliament, with periodic switches between Labour and Conservative governments
effecting an oscillatory economy.

Essentially, if you were bored of Westminster doing nothing more than
turning welfare up to eleven and back down to nought every decade or so, Liberal Democrats were the party for you.
This let them have policies on other issues and generally they were the only among the big three to even
admit that mental health was a thing, let alone a social issue.

## General Election 2015 Manifesto

First mention of mental health: page 1 of a 158-page manifesto. It's there on the front cover.

<blockquote>Invest £8 billion to
improve our NHS
and guarantee equal
care for mental
health</blockquote>

There's a feeling throughout the Liberal Democrats' manifesto that they're more than ever aware of the effect
of mental health on wider issues.

Like most other parties, there's a promise that mental health will finally
have parity with physical health and not treated like an alien concept
tacked onto the end of the NHS's mandate.

<blockquote>Our NHS will have the money it needs, and the Scottish
Parliament will have the resources to make sure mental health
will have equal status with physical health. Those facing anxiety
and depression will be seen swiftly, people struggling not to harm
themselves will find emergency help at A&amp;E and teenagers suffering
from eating disorders will get the help they need close to home."</blockquote>

While rekindling their previous status as the party representing the needs of young people
&ndash; tarnished somewhat{{include ref.html text="somewhat here meaning \"almost irrevocably\""}} by the increase in tuition fees to £9,000 per year &ndash; the Liberal Democrats include a note that apprenticeships should lead the way
in mental health-conscious employment.

<blockquote>Liberal Democrats will protect young people’s entitlements to the
welfare safety net, while getting them the help they need to get their
first job. That means doubling the number of businesses that hire
apprentices. It also means providing support that has been proven
to work, like work experience placements that help them get a first
foot on the career ladder. These placements should be tailored for
those with disabilities or mental health problems and those with
parental responsibilities and we will work to expand the availability of
placements into new sectors including manufacturing, science and
technology.</blockquote>

As part of a section detailing how to protect the NHS and build a healthier society,
the party gives their detailed plan on how to address the mental-physical disparity.
Stating that &quot;one in four of us will experience mental health problems,&quot;
the manifesto claims that &quot;mental health problems cost the country as much
as £100 billion each year yet less than a quarter of people with
depression get the treatment they need.&quot;

The Liberal Democrats were successful during the last government in pushing through amendments to the Mental Health Act 1983,
calling for &quot;parity of esteem&quot; between mental and physical health. The amendments were part of the otherwise highly controversial Health and Social Care Act 2012, which allows for GPs to have control over budgets and permits some privatisation of public health services.
The Conservative Party lay claim to the same amendments in their manifesto.

In numbers, the Liberal Democrats want to increase annual mental health spending in England's NHS by £500 million by 2016/17.
They also promise the funds for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to manage similar investments in mental health.
These funds will be spent improving access to mental health services and introducing firmer waiting time standards therein.
Six weeks will be the waiting time from referral to therapy for depression or anxiety;
two weeks will be the standard for young people experiencing a first episode of psychosis.

More access to talking therapies is on the Liberal Democrat agenda too,
with a long-term goal of everyone who can benefit from such therapy being seen.
The manifesto promises an interim target of getting 25% of those in need into treatment.

A final point of the plan is to improve children's mental health services.

<blockquote>Revolutionise children’s mental health services. With the £250m
a year announced in this year’s Budget we will implement the
proposals outlined in the report of the Government’s Children’s
Mental Health Taskforce. This means building better links with
schools, ensuring all children develop mental resilience, and
getting support and care quickly to those who are struggling. Our
investment will help ensure children can access high-quality care
closer to home.</blockquote>
