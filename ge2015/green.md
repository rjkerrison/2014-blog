The Green Party has long been loud on the issue of mental health.
The party's original flagship ideology of environmentalism could never garner
total support in a country where the environment is definitely low on most people's agendas,
and over the past five years, Green has become much more than a single-issue party.

## General Election 2015 Manifesto

On page 26 of the Green manifesto, the ball gets rolling under an emotive and poignant heading.

<blockquote>We will tackle the crisis of our time: Mental health</blockquote>

Other manifestos are sparse in their discussion of numbers, other than that of the Liberal Democrats which quotes a few, but the Green Party is loud on the statistical situation:

<blockquote>There has been an alarming rise in mental health problems in recent years, especially among young people. According to NHS
England, mental illness accounts for 28% of illness but only 13% of NHS spending. In the course of a year, one in four adults
experiences some form of mental ill health. If you have diabetes there’s a 92% chance you’ll get treatment. If you have a mental
illness, that chance goes down to 28%. Around 70% of prisoners have two or more mental health conditions. The government’s own
Chief Medical Officer says mental health should be given greater priority.</blockquote>

The Green Party promise to change the culture surrounding mental health as well as modify spending and training.

<blockquote>It will take time to train more staff and expand services but the Green Party will put an end to mental health’s Cinderella status and
achieve parity of esteem by 2020.</blockquote>

This *Cinderella status* thing confused me.
Googling revealed that they might mean that mental health is a sports team who surmounted insurmountable odds to win a tournament paradoxically,
just like Cinderella did in the original comic book.

Further Googling led to an interesting and seemingly formative [article on the NHS website][CinderellaArticle] wherein Dr Ed Mitchell,
NHS England's Director for Long Term Conditions,
discusses the way mental health is estranged from and underfunded in comparison with physical health.
I believe this is the sense in which the Green Party mean *Cinderella status* also.

In their dense manifesto, they outline the following priniciple points:

<blockquote>We will:
	<ul>
		<li>Ensure that spending on mental health care rises within our overall commitment to increase real spending on health.</li>
		<li>Ensure that no one waits more than 28 days for access to talking therapies.</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>

The first two points are echoed by other parties,
though the solid 28-day wait is only mentioned by Labour and the Liberal Democrats specify a 6-week wait.{% include ref.html text="28 days is 4 weeks. 6 weeks is 42 days. Mathematical anxiety is a very real thing, so I'm just covering." %}

<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>Ensure that everyone experiencing a mental health crisis, including children and young people, should have safe and speedy
		access to quality care, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</li>
		<li>The use of police cells as ‘places of safety’ for children should be eliminated by 2016, and by the end of the next Parliament
		should only occur for adults in exceptional circumstances.</li>
		<li>Ensure that everyone who requires a mental health bed should be able to access one in their local NHS Trust area, unless they
		need specialist care and treatment. If specialist care is required, then this should be provided within a reasonable distance of
		where the patient lives.</li>
		<li>Implement a campaign to end the discrimination and stigma associated with mental health through supporting the Time for
		Change programme and offering employment support to those with mental health problems.</li>
		<li>Invest in dementia services, ensuring that support is available for all affected by this debilitating disease, including families and
		carers.</li>
		<li>Pay special attention to any mental health issues of mothers during and after pregnancy, children and adolescents, Black and
		Minority Ethnic people, refugees, the LGBTIQ communities and ex-service people and their families.</li>
		<li>Improve access to addiction services, including both drugs and alcohol addiction.</li>
		<li>Give higher priority to the physical healthcare of those with mental health problems.</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>



In a display of intelligence rarely seen from any other political party,
the list of criteria above is followed by a *Joining up the policies* section,
which asks

<blockquote>So what do mental health, drugs, crime and welfare have to do with each other?</blockquote>

The answer is a hell of a lot, and the Green Party is well aware.
They talk of how the current welfare system breeds desperation and stress, with which I'd entirely
agree.{% include ref.html text="having essentially wasted my final year of university due to anxiety stemming from how terrifying the thought of unemployment was." %}

The Green Party's discussion of drugs here follows from a point they made in *We will act to prevent illness and expand primary and community care*,
in which the party asserts that it will &quot;treat drug addiction as a health problem rather than a crime, making drugs policy the responsibility of the Department of Health
in order to ensure that resources are targeted at supporting, not punishing, drug users.&quot;

In a section on *Equality and Diversity*, the party promises to
&quot;work towards ending stigma against people with mental health problems, including discrimination in employment,&quot;
which, albeit aspecific, is still a commitment to an underaddressed aspect of the difficulty facing those with mental health conditions.

The Green manifesto is vast and it frequently reminds of the link between one issue and another.
Its holistic approach is very much welcome at a time when the government seems incapable of considering consequences.
Of all the parties, only the [Liberal Democrats](../libdem) have more to say on the subject of mental health,
and the Green Party might arguably be saying it better.
