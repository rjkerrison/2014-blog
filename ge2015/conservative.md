I wouldn't automatically associate the Conservative Party with a commitment to mental health;
from the looks of it, neither would they.

## General Election 2015 Manifesto

The term *mental health* first appears on page 30 of an 84-page document.

It features in a paragraph titled *we will help you back into work if you have a long-term yet treatable condition*:

<blockquote>We will
also provide significant new support for mental health,
benefiting thousands of people claiming out-of-work
benefits or being supported by Fit for Work.</blockquote>

It's not clear what &quot;support&quot; means in the context.
It could mean financial support or treatment in the form of talking therapies.
Since it immediately follows a veiled threat that people suffering from long-term illness who refuse recommended medical treatment to help them back into work will receive a &quot;review [on] whether their benefits should be reduced,&quot;
I'm going to assume they mean financial support.

<blockquote>We will continue to take your mental health as seriously as your physical health</blockquote>

&hellip;is the name of a paragraph on page 41, which takes credit for the amendments to the Mental Health Act 1983 that were widely agreed to be the saving grace of the Health and Social Care Act 2012.
The Liberal Democrats lay claim to the same amendments in their manifesto.

Without citing numbers, they promise to increase funding for mental health care and promise to ensure there are therapists in every part of the country.

<blockquote>We will enforce the new access and waiting time
standards for people experiencing mental ill-health,
including children and young people.</blockquote>

It's fortunate they specified that children and young people are included by the term &quot;people&quot; as sometimes children and young people are listed under &quot;aliens&quot; or &quot;pets&quot; instead.

The rest of the sentence is good.
Everything on the NHS seems to be privy to waiting times, as there's something of an annual witch-hunt in Britain to go Hulk on the below average hospitals. Being below average is apparently a sin that can be easily avoided by all parties in the mind of the numerically illiterate bureacrats who spark these witch-hunts.

Nonetheless, if we're going to have some sense of metrics by which to track and to improve access to NHS treatment, mental health treatment should be included.
After all, mental health is included by the term &quot;health.&quot;
See my earlier remark on children and young people.

<blockquote>We will ensure that women
have access to mental health support during and after
pregnancy, while strengthening the health visiting
programme for new mothers.</blockquote>

This is an explicitly mentioned prong of [UKIP's mental health manifesto]:(../ukip).
It's a necessary policy, quite notably omitted from the [Labour manifesto]:(../labour).

Next time the Conservatives talk about mental health is as part of an aspecific fanfare about their introduction of &quot;social impact bonds&quot; and &quot;payment-by-results&quot;.

It comes up again when discussing their crime prevention plans.

<blockquote>We will ensure proper provision of health and community-based
places of safety for people suffering mental health
crises &ndash; saving police time and stopping vulnerable people
being detained in police custody.</blockquote>

It's hard to tell what's meant by &quot;community-based places of safety.&quot;
It sounds either idealistic like the failed *Big Society* approach to community services,
or euphemistic for something Draconian.
Not having vulnerable people exposed to police custody sounds so basically sensible it's a shame it had to be said at all,
but I'm not seeing what their community-based plan entails, and I suspect neither do they.

The Conservative Party's final attempt at showcasing their understanding of mental health issues is on page 80 or 84, during another fanfare &ndash; this time celebrating their regard for the Armed Forces.

<blockquote>We have delivered proper mental
health support and priority access to medical treatments
for veterans.</blockquote>

Definitely a necessity, but again, this is just showboating and not part of any policy or promise.

The following terms never appear once in the whole 84-page document:

* anxiety
* depression
* wellbeing

Overall, the manifesto has an admission that mental health treatment needs to be reformed and that mental health should have parity with physical health, a few hints at some policies thereof, but no real discussion of what or how.

Only [Labour](../labour) are more lacking in their apparent commitment to mental health.

The [Green Party](../green) and the [Liberal Democrats](../libdem) demonstrate a much greater understanding of mental health and a proportionate commitment to the issue.
Even [UKIP](../ukip) outstreak the Conservatives &ndash;albeit only for UK residents who have paid taxes for an five years or more.

I'd expect a governing party to have the best understanding of what ails its people and how that should be addressed.
