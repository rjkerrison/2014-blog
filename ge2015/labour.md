In the time of zero-hour contracts and rising living costs,
stress and anxiety are rife.
Labour talks focusses on economic triggers that might exacerbate mental ill-health,
but generally seems quiet on the issue of mental health at large.

## General Election 2015 Manifesto

In the Labour Party's 86-page manifesto, the first mention of mental health features on page 11 in passing.
The issue is discussed in-depth *only* on page 35.
There's not one mention of any of:

* "depression";
* "dementia";
* or "anxiety" besides the phrase "public anxiety about [immigration's] effects on wages."

The first time mental health is mentioned by Labour is in the following part of a three-pronged explanation of Labour's understanding of the importance of certain NHS services.

<blockquote>When mental health problems are not spotted early,
people can deteriorate and need more intensive support.</blockquote>

That single paragraph targeting mental health is specifically:

<blockquote>Mental health will be given the same priority as physical health. People will
have the same right to psychological therapies as they currently have to drugs
and medical treatments. To help address the problem of undiagnosed mental
illness, NHS staff training will include mental health. We will increase the
proportion of the mental health budget that is spent on children, and make
sure that teachers have training so they can identify problems early and link
children up with support. To support young people’s health and wellbeing, we
will encourage the development of social and emotional skills, for example
through the use of mindfulness to build resilience. And we will set out a strategy
with the goal of ensuring that the great majority of patients can access talking
therapies within 28 days, and that all children who need it can access schoolbased
counselling.</blockquote>

That's it.
The optimistic target of 28-day waiting lists for talking therapy is a very welcome promise,
but one would expect to see much more from the Labour Party – often seen as the party of the people,
the representatives of the 99%.

This fleeting glance in the direction of mental health is reiterated in the summary of the manifesto:
<blockquote>give mental health the same priority as physical health, with a new right to
access talking therapies</blockquote>

Is it enough?

No. The [Conservatives](../conservative) do better and even they are dwarfed completely by both the understanding and commitments laid down by [UKIP](../ukip), the [Green Party](../green) and the [Liberal Democrats](..\/ibdem).
