UKIP have a fairly loud lead policy, which is along the lines of &quot;send them home and don't let them back in.&quot;
This attitude to immigration has been vocalised more than their eponymous policy demanding freedom from Brussels and has garnered a lot of support.

Nonetheless, in an effort to be taken seriously, the party does have a fairly complete manifesto; refreshingly, mental health is high on their agenda.

## General Election 2015 Manifesto

UKIP first mention mental health as early as page 5 of 76, in their *Introduction*.
They later go into depth on their mental health policies on page 16.

In the aforementioned introduction to their manifesto, Suzanne Evans promises to &quot;invest £1.5 billion into mental health and dementia services&quot;,
though whether this is an annual investment, a one-off injection or a commitment over the next five budgets is not immediately clear, but clarified later in the document.
On a similar note, the introduction states UKIP will &quot;pay carers an extra £572 [per] year&quot;.

In their section on the NHS, UKIP outline their plans to improve the way our health service tackles mental health,
leading with an uncited assertion that &quot;patients with mental health problems frequently feel ignored and let down.&quot;
It would be nice to have something verifying such a strong statement, but anecdotally it does make sense.

<blockquote>UKIP takes a &#8216;whole person&#8217; approach to health and that means giving mental health parity with physical health.</blockquote>

This mirrors other parties, though the &quot;whole person&quot; soundbite is unique to UKIP's manifesto.
Their plans to acheive this consist of a number of strategems, which are disappointingly vague.

<blockquote>Directing patients diagnosed with a debilitating long-term condition or terminal illness to mental health professionals when appropriate</blockquote>

Here, I find the wording inconclusive.
Trying to ignore my personal bias against UKIP,
this is still more than a little imprecise.
&quot;Terminal illness&quot; clearly speaks of physical conditions such as cancers,
heart disease and many others, so overall I'd have to guess they want to give people who have been given a poor prognosis the access they may want to counselling or therapy.
This makes total sense to me, but I wonder why they didn't say that but instead opted to state they'd
&quot;[direct terminal or debilitated patients] to mental health professionals.&quot;

It's an almost commercial phrasing and speaks too much of stiff upper lips.
It rings of the offensively indirect &quot;[adverbally] challenged&quot; phrasing which was all too rife in the noughties,
when Britain was quite frankly incapable of being frank about a lot of classically unmentionable social issues.

I'd expect UKIP to be a little more forthcoming in their ability to discuss a difficult issue,
given that their popularity is due to saying what other parties won't &ndash; whether that is what needs to be said notwithstanding.

I'm also not sure what they mean by &quot;directing.&quot; Where &quot;referring&quot; is a much more practised and well-defined term in medical literature, &quot;directing&quot; could mean referral or simply handing a patient a flyer or giving a verbal recommendation.
While the latter two practises could be a great help to a lot of people faced with overcoming a negative prognosis who hadn't considered the availability of mental health support,
it's a wide canyon between that and referral, which suggests integration of services and thus an easier path to receiving support than by simply being reminded that it exists.

<blockquote>Recognising there is often a link between addiction and mental illness and offering appropriate treatment where this is the case</blockquote>

There is a refreshing kind of frankness here, but again it seems defamatory and detached, rather than understanding and supportive.
Perhaps again that's my own bias to read anything from UKIP as if it's been written directly under a *Daily Mail* headline.

I find my attempt to take UKIP seriously a little easier with the following policy.

<blockquote>Offering direct access to specialist mental health treatment for pregnant women or mothers of children under 12 months of age</blockquote>

Much more like it.
It's also just a good idea.
Post-martem depression is a major issue and although there's support available, there's too much red tape.
Allowing direct access to treatment for all pregnant women and new mothers seems a much better approach.
Needing support for one's mental health is daunting enough without feeling one needs to prove the need.

I wonder why didn't they say &quot;treatment&quot; earlier instead of picking a word that speaks of suits and labcoats and a generally Orwellian approach.

<blockquote>Fighting the stigma around mental illness and supporting those seeking to get back into work.</blockquote>

Arguably the most unaddressed issue in the realm of mental health is that of employment.
If I break my leg, explaining any consequential gap in employment is easy, regardless of how long the gap or how ridiculous the circumstance.
It's not so much the case if I have a gap in my employment due to depression.
While conquering the underlying stigma around mental ill-health is going to be as much an uphill struggle as any major societal shift in opinion,
finding ways to work with employers in order to help
those affected by mental illness back into work after a period of unemployment is a pragmatic first step.

How UKIP plan to do this is unclear, but it is at least evident that they've thought beyond the basic &quot;mental health is an underprioritised problem in the UK&quot; and actually considered aspects of that problem.

Finally, they end their set of promises for improving mental health's handling by the NHS with their most assertive one.

<blockquote>Patients experiencing distress or exhibiting mental ill-health issues when admitted to
hospital should have both their physical health and mental wellbeing assessed. This must
not just be an optional extra: we will end the postcode lottery for psychiatric liaison services
in acute hospitals and A&amp;E departments.</blockquote>

Tired soundbites aside, this is a great approach and is well within the power of any government.

UKIP state that they'll fund these changes with £170 million annual investment, accounting for £0.85 billion of the £1.5 billion stated as an investment to help improve mental health and dementia treatment across the NHS.

## Who qualifies?

This is UKIP, and as much as we should give them a fair chance to voice decent policies &ndash; there are flaws with how they address mental health, but however vague or jarring their language, they do at least show a commitment to improving mental health in the UK &ndash; they undo all of it in a tirade against &quot;health-tourism.&quot;

The stringent set of demands from UKIP on who is and isn't deserving of good-health is as follows:
* &quot;UKIP will insist migrants and visitors who come to Britain have approved medical insurance&quot;
* NHS numbers and full eligibility for NHS services will be granted only to those who have
** the permanent right to remain in Britain
** *and* have paid UK taxes for *at least five years*

That's right, international students and skilled or manual workers who have lived here less than 5 years: if you get ill, UKIP do not care.

That's sure not to cause anyone stress or anxiety.

<blockquote>Urgent treatment will still be given to those who need it, but non-urgent treatment will be charged for.</blockquote>

UKIP won't let their fellow man die in A&amp;E, but if it's an ongoing illness &ndash; including depression &ndash; you can either pay for it, on top of the up to 5 years of taxes you've paid, or they'll just watch you suffer gladly in their whites-only towns.

It's a better promise towards improved mental health than either [Labour](../labour) or the [Conservatives](../conservative), but it's far from the other parties,
and forsaking the mental health of migrants is impermissible.
