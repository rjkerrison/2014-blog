### Wordpress, Tumblr, Blogspot all suck
They just don't have the level of customisability &ndash; it's a word &ndash; that I really look for in a web solution.

I've been playing with HTML and CSS for years, so I thought it was about time I developed my own blog.
GitHub Pages suits me perfectly because after a week of playing, I finally learnt how to use Jekyll.

I'll keep a track below of anything that I've personally developed, i.e. isn't taken from another Git, StackOverflow,
an online tutorial or simply standard Bootstrap.

* The Carousel's Play/Pause Button
 * Adapting the standard Bootstrap carousel example to have a play/pause button proved difficult. The resulting code is at *_script/carousel.js* and *_includes/carousel.html*.
* Nothing else.
