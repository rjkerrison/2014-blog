CHVRCHES second full-length splash _Every Open Eye_ had a lot to live up to in its predecessor,
_The Bones Of What You Believe_.
That first album was a fresh addition to electronic pop, though perhaps guilty of a bipartite structure.
Where singles 'We Sink', 'Lies' and 'The Mother We Share' relied heavily on the juxtaposition of Lauren Mayberry's clean vocals
with lyrics charged by the reluctant self-actualisation indicative of and unique to Scotland,
others on the album were happier to draw attention to Iain Cook and Martin Doherty's talent for synthesised instrumentals.

The follow-up marries _Bones_'s two halves in what seems to be a coherent CHVRCHES sound,
only the bones of which were previously present;
_Every Open Eye_ is both bolder in general and tamer in its extremes.

'Never Ending Circles' is a capable opener: a gorgeous four-chord intro, short and sweet verses
and the hookiest of hooky choruses from the Glaswegian trio to date.
It establishes a murkier, fuller sound for the band as a backdrop for yet more strange synecdoche
to add to CHVRCHES's dictionary of idioms.

'Leave A Trace' is an absolute delight, never relenting in delivering crisp and catchy lyrics
against a synthetic tutti in a perfectly produced number.
It also introduces us to apparent funereal undertones,
later revisited in 'Bury It' and 'Playing Dead' in particular.

<blockquote>Take care to bury all that you can,
take care to leave a trace of a man.</blockquote>

We've then got enjambement extraordinaire 'Keep You On My Side' which has all the tone
of a bittersweet summer anthem akin to 'Heaven' or 'Boys of Summer'.
CHVRCHES's obsession with the anatomical is once again present, with some bizarrely emotive allusions.

<blockquote>We bide our time, stay afloat, keeping the sun off of our bones.</blockquote>

'Make Them Gold' might not be quite so biologically bewitched when
Mayberry promises to _"take the best part of ourselves and make them gold"_;
it's unclear whether she means our great sense of humour and kindness to others
or our ears and patellae.
The song is upbeat – or is it?
The charm of CHVRCHES is in the way it's never quite clear whether Mayberry's
almost adorably sweet tonality is just a sinister veil for a cut-throat mindset,
and never more so than with 'Make Them Gold'.
A heavy drumbeat ends it abruptly and delivers us to the third promotional release with a jolt.

Fifth track 'Clearest Blue' is frightening reminiscent of Depeche Mode, threatening in its instrumental bridge
to drop into 'Just Can't Get Enough' but rewarding the listener with a bassline much less grating.
Its appeal as a single is abundantly obvious, with a beat and a hook that define it as an absolute banger.
It's also the provider of the anatomical album name this time around, aligning it with _Bones_'s bonus track 'Strong Hand'.

'High Enough To Carry You Over' finds a lead voice within Martin Doherty
which _Bones_ never quite found, though not through lack of trying.
Where 'You Caught the Light' and 'Under The Tide' jarred somewhat against the rest of _Bones_,
'High Enough To Carry You Over' is one of _Every Open Eye_'s strongest and adds to its overall sound.
It's beautiful, sounding so much like it dropped out of the 1980s.
It could be the theme to a beta-male-driven feature-length romp that can't decide whether it's action or romcom.
Hell, maybe it's CHVRCHES's contribution to a rescoring of _Drive_ that Radio 1's 'Get Away' just wasn't.
Picturing Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan cruising through Los Angeles at sunset fits this backing eerily well.
The synths are among the album's best
and the lyrics' insistence on repetition only better underpoints the raw emotion of the piece.

Its successor 'Empty Threat' establishes itself as back on the Mayberry train within its first heartbeat
and therafter functions almost like a reply,
the next scene in a rock opera.
The track has a greater exploration of its core concept than 'High Enough To Carry You Over',
both lyrically and musically, breaking down into an introspective bridge between penultimate and final choruses.

We enter the album's decrescendo with the anime quality of 'Down Side Of Me',
a calm, reflective affair with a gentleness to it which is seen again in three tracks later in closer in 'Afterglow'.

'Playing Dead' conjures up yet further images of Japanese subculture, but here it's SEGA theme tunes via a mid-90s electronic backing track.
Once again, the synths are perfectly partnered with another catchy chorus and further verbose verses.

'Bury It' is probably the best candidate for an album-swap.
Its angsty keyboard work and angstier opening line – _"cover up, cover up, cover up that you're useless"_ –
drop it into the quintessential synthpop territory CHVRCHES have claimed as their own.

The aforementioned closer 'Afterglow' is an all-out more chilled affair, every bit the glorious dying embers
as its title suggests.
It's a lullaby if ever CHVRCHES recorded one, with noticeably sweeter lyrics than its predecessors,
landing on four counts of _"I've given up all I can"_ from Mayberry
in a tearjerkingly sincere turn.

_Every Open Eye_ is a tour de force from the Glaswegian trio, showing that _Bones_ was very much just the tip of the iceberg
where CHVRCHES's repertoire is concerned.
