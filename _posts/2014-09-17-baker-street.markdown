Popular culture has a wee obsession with Baker Street. It stems, no doubt, from *The Strand*&apos;s
second most famous serials and short stories. Why, though, did Arthur Conan Doyle &ndash; a General
Practitioner at St Bartholomew&apos;s Hospital, London and precursor to Michael Crichton &ndash; choose
such an innocuous location as the home of his super sleuth?

My interest with Baker Street lies somewhat beyond 221B, which itself lay beyond the end of the original run of the street.
Baker Street stands in history as the location of the first underground railway station.
The original platforms still exist, with [many] million London Underground passengers passing through them daily.
