According to a lot of writers, being intelligent is equivalent to being infinitely educated;
chess is a frequent casualty of this logical fallacy.

I started playing chess aged 9 and played regularly until I was 11.
I played often and could beat anyone who didn't.
Depending on the strength of my accent, this makes me either a superhero or a supervillain according to screenwriters
who might well think Batman could beat Rafael Nadal at tennis.

## Weasley v McGonagall

Take everyone's favourite Dumbledore.
He declared 12-year-old Ron Weasley{% include ref.html	text="Ron was born 1st March 1980; Harry murders his first DADA teacher on [4th June 1992](http://www.hp-lexicon.org/timelines/calendars/calendar_ps.html \"Harry Potter Calendar\")." %}
to have played "the greatest game of chess Hogwarts had ever seen,"
which either means wizards are terrible at chess or that instead of either noticing his rat was Timothy Spall or attending latin class
&ndash; come on mate, it's *ede līmācēs* &ndash;
Ronald Weasley misspent his youth studying a game not even bookish Hermione bothered perfecting.

The Dark (King's) Knight."	lightbox="Chess"	title="Ron ponders his next move instead of whipping out his phone to use an online chess computer like a normal kid." %}

I'm not even sure why Rowling had the Chess challenge,
but perhaps Wizard's Chess was reverse-engineered from the need to have transfiguration used as part of McGonagall's defence.
How you leap from protecting alchemy's top prize by animating inanimate objects to a board game, I'm not sure.
I suspect she'd recently watched Jumanji.

## Chess and Mutants

In Bryan Singer's groundbreaking *X-Men* movies,{% include ref.html	text="Today's army of comic book film franchises owes its existence to Singer's *X-Men* and *X2* and Raimi's *Spider-Man*, without which a commission for *Iron Man* would have been infeasible." %} Magneto and Professor X have themselves a cosy game after the former's every attempted genocide.

It requires very little suspension of disbelief to accept that a professor of anthropology at Oxford University
from a well-to-do British family spent his youth playing chess.
Holocaust survivor and thinly-veiled Malcolm X analogue Magneto might have been a little less likely to pick up the game in his much more turbulent youth.
It nonetheless seems less of a stretch that he and Charles Xavier would reach a similar level of ability in the game than it does that Ron Weasley outclasses every other student at Hogwarts ever.

{% include	image.html	url="http://media.comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/x-men-days-of-future-past-mtv-movie-awards.jpg"	caption="Weirdly, Charles always seems to know Eric's next planned move."	title="It's hard to tell from this picture, but I think Xavier has moved once and captured a pawn. Guy's a pro."	lightbox="Chess" %}

From a storytelling point of view, the chess here is more than its usual function as a marker of an intelligent foe.
The metaphor is actually a reversal of the abstraction which originally birthed chess.
Where the game is an analogy of a political or military battle,
the plot of each decent *X-Men* film is precisely that.

## 221b Checkmater Street

Sherlock sequel *A Game Of Shadows* gives Guy Ritchie's incarnation of John Moriarty a game against the ubiquitous{% include ref.html text="*adj.*: Out of copyright." %} Holmes.
They open on a board on a balcony overlooking Reichenbach Falls, before doing away with all that physical pieces nonsense and choosing to complete the game in visual memory by shouting moves at each other while simultaneously choreographing a stylised fistfight in a psychically linked dreamscape.

I'm hoping cinemagoers took that particular chess match with a bucketload of salt.
After all, this is from the same universe where Mark Strong rises from a tomb and attempts to exterminate parliament by gassing them with a poison to which he's built up an immunity, thereby combining a standard DC Comics plot, the Gunpowder plot and the plot of The New Testament.

## The Chess Is On

Chess still creeps into fictions that practice a little more realism, including superslick bigger-they-are-harder-they-fall crime series *Hustle* &ndash;
one of the best shows the BBC ever made before some nincompoop declared that glamorising crime was not okay without some Adam West-esque campness to take the edge off, for which the latter series suffered greatly.

The early series were great, and episode four of the first featured conniving, IQ-boasting, former top cop Victor Maher.
His introduction to conman extroardinaire Michael "Mickey Bricks" Stone is cuttingly sinister and speaks of his massive boasty intellectness.

<div class="shrinkwrap">
<blockquote>Do you like chess, Michael?</blockquote>
<blockquote class="right">I prefer snakes and ladders.</blockquote>
</div>

We're then treated to a convoluted bank heist commissioned by Mr Maher, who happens to be the very same bank's head of security.

{% include	image.html	url="http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111010023616/thehustle/images/thumb/1/1b/Hustle_Cops_and_Robbers.jpg/500px-Hustle_Cops_and_Robbers.jpg"	caption="\"Okay, I've read the rules, but how does a castle jump over a king?\""	lightbox="Chess"	title="Victor Maher confronts Mickey Bricks in a totally unsuccesful attempt to beat him at metaphor-chess." %}

An *Ocean's Eleven*-esque plot twist then somehow negates the fact that everyone involved in the heist is totally going to prison
because it happens to be checkmate-like.
Genuinely, despite being a merciless megalomaniac,
big bad Maher accepts defeat for the sole reason that in the absence of any morality
he governs his reactions based on chess etiquette and walks away from the metaphor-board instead of metaphor-throwing the metaphor-pieces around the metaphor-room.

It's kind of like how *The Usual Suspects* would have panned out if the police knew where Keiser Soze and Mr Kobayashi met for drinks,
but the police were so impressed with the whole [make-it-up-as-you-go-along thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_%28TV_series%29) that they just let Soze walk.

## The Fastest Chess Alive

Still, the absolute worst, cheesiest, most pathetically lazy implementation of the "he won at chess so he must be an evil genius" is in the camembert *Arrow* spinoff *The Flash*, which is much more *Sarah Jane Adventures* than *Torchwood*.

If you've not seen *The Flash*,
all you really need to know is that JD from *Scrubs*'s big brother Dan is Dr Wells.
a good but possibly evil genius scientist confined to a wheelchair except he walks around when nobody's looking.

There are mutants but the showrunners can't/don't call them that and the series revolves around an exploding particle collider, which would be topical if it were still 2008.

There's also a guy called Barry who can run really fast and he grins all the time, presumably because all the other DC heroes would sue him for copyright infringement if he brooded.

One particularly lacking episode sees scorned physicist Hartley Rathaway launching a vendetta against his evil-not-evil not-disabled former employer using a sonic boom thing which is linked to his ubertinnitis.
Ordinarily, we wouldn't be concerned, but he *beats Dr Wells at chess* so obviously he's more badass than the previous 9 mutants-of-the-week.

{% include	image.html	imgur="f8zSGa2"	lightbox="Chess"	caption="Slimy-looking and good at chess? Barry's gonna have to run really *really* fast."	title="Dr Wells and Hartley Rathaway play a game of TV chess." %}

After a while, we have a showdown between the Cheshire cat and this villanous spectacle-wearing genius.
It seems to be going all *The Flash*'s way, only Dr Wells gives the red-leather-clad blur a warning to heed:

<blockquote>He's a master of concealing his endgame.</blockquote>

Somebody not only wrote that line, but got paid for it.

Screenwriters are clever people, so why the reliance on chess as a cultural emblem for intelligence?
The winner of a game of chess isn't the smarter, the more tactical, the more cunning or the more evil of the players:
it's whoever has better studied the game.

Thinking about that awful "concealing his endgame" line, I wonder if the writers of *The Flash* are of the same school of thought as Zapp Brannigan.

<blockquote>In the game of chess, Kif, one can never let one's opponent see one's pieces.</blockquote>

Or maybe they just confuse their games.
