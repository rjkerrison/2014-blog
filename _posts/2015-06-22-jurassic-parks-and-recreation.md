Colin Trevorrow's latest instalment in the *Jurassic Park* series thaws the ice left behind after the meteorites of *The Lost World* and *Jurassic Park III* all but wiped out the franchise. The task of the deextinction of Spielberg's dino-world was never going to be as simple as Mr DNA might have you believe. Mathematical lingo misuse and corporate spies dressed in Hawaiian shirts just aren't relevant any more.

What's more is that everyone's seen dinosaurs already. Even if the classic John Williams score set atop stunned faces and marching sauropods doesn't give you your fill, the BBC had a whole 3 hours of Kenneth Brannagh's narration of CGI dinos. The T-Rex is just so passé. Even the [Natural History Museum ditched its diplodocus in favour of a blue whale earlier this year](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-31025229). How do you reinvigorate the public's interest in tyrant theropods?

This question is reflected in the film's internal universe. The world created in *World* hinges on the same corporate escalation that forces sequels to have "more teeth." The plot, the creatures and the spectacle of the fictional theme park are all aware of the need to go one bigger in order to capture the public imagination.

*Jurassic World* is thus in every sense an escalation of the first film. It leads with the question "what if they got the park up-and-running?" which lends itself to a spectacular silver screen display of a theme park unlike any other. I've twice seen the film, twice seen every on-screen death and yet still, given the chance, I'd want to visit this park, though preferably on a week when the Indominus Rex isn't on a rampage.

Sacrifices have to be made to cram in more spectacle. The establishment of our characters is efficient rather than subtle, though in fairness, how many seconds did it take to establish that Alan Grant hated children? Did *Park* really pull any punches in introducing Ian Malcolm's flirtatious, intellectually righteous smugness? Were we at all eased into John Hammond's credentials as a mad scientist? We might lose the Spielberg family-friendly character arcs, but that's no bad thing. I was always pretty miffed with how reverse-engineered they felt in the first place.{% include ref.html text="It's like Steven decides his characters are going to hate the thing they spend the film doing after the fact. \"There's snakes in the tomb – he should hate snakes.\" \"He has to go on a boat – he should hate boats.\" \"He spends the film looking after two kids – make him a paedophobe.\" I imagine there's a rejected draft of *E.T.* where the little guy expresses his hatred for bicycles and telephones by spitting on them in the opening few minutes." %}

*World* carries none of that nonsense. This is a film about terrifying dinosaurs and trained raptors. The thematic hints at military arrogance and the fallacy of control peter out in favour of Chris Pratt badassery. Our human antagonist has escalated from a buckmaking employee to an imbecile militant. Capitalist self-interest is no longer the goto villain – we're back to the overzealous American military. Goodbye Hans Gruber, hello predator drones.

We're not totally in pre-*Die Hard* mode, although the action sequences and dialogue would suggest it. There are moments that belong to 2015, but they're few and far between and exist primarily for laughs – which to their credit, they get – rather than social commentary. Dialogue only ever strays away from pure entertainment or necessary plot progression for one of two reasons: to juxtapose this park with its prototype, in which case it's awesome, or to pass comment on our lead's life choices, for which it's hard to forgive.

Park manager Claire Dearing first glides into shot with all the poise of an Olympic diver and none of the expectant motion. Her rigidity reflects in her dress – a crystal white blazer atop a possibly whiter pencil skirt, impeccably clean lilac heels and an inch-perfect red bobcut to match. The only variation from the most measured order and symmetry in Dearing's appearance is in her freckles, which even then seem deliberately placed. She is the absolute image of control, of which fact Trevorrow allows no subtlety.

I'd be loathe to call her presence warm or encouraging, but there's a comfort in watching Dearing introduce potential investors to the prehistoric zoo like there is in watching the ticking of a clock or an algorithmic manipulation of an equation.

In contrast, Dearing's sister Karen Mitchell (Judy Greer) is the epitomy of a fatigued parent. The sisters are extreme caricatures of womanhood; sadly not characters. A phone call between them is the one scene in the entire film that qualifies a pass of the Bechdel test, but serves only to question Dearing's life choices – specifically that parenthood is not her priority. It's disappointing from the first film in the series where the children aren't loathesome that it so readily undermines its female lead. To add insult to injury, Mitchell is a total waste of Greer's comedic talent.

*World*'s reptile female characters are another matter. Genetic hybrid Indominus is consistently self-reliant, displays great intelligence and takes no prisoners. She holds her own and puts to shame every arrogant human who believes she can be tamed.

Indominus's fellow fearsome female Blue is leader of a velociraptor hunting pack. Her wiliness and impeccable judge of character outstrip those of her captors, yet she herself is hard to pin down. The relationship between Blue and raptor handler Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is entertaining to watch, partly because Pratt is so likable and partly because her eyes surprisingly communicate a wonderful sense that a lot of cogs are turning in her CGI head.

With the trailer to *Jurassic World* so hellbent on making the film seem dangerous, crisp and cool – following suit, perhaps, of the "I've Got No Strings" *Age of Ultron* trailer – I was concerned we might be seeing a po-faced Chris Pratt in Grady. Thankfully, the film's tone is much lighter than the overly dramatised trailer suggests. There's not once the sense that *World* takes itself too seriously, which plays much to the advantage of a film featuring dino-on-dino action.

Grady is cool and collected and good company throughout. Save for his maghrebin sidekick, Grady is the only character to show any real respect or understanding of the cretaceous creatures. And just in case his dismisal of militant idiot Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) wasn't quite enough to win the audience's favour, he saves the dog, albeit a bipedal caucasian one. This establishment is quite undone by his later encounter with Dearing where his boyish teasing borders on and then invades misogyny, but between the raptor whisperer's jokey nature and her complete disregard of his manner, the interaction is ultimately harmless. The pair are fleshed out a little more later, rendering this sloppy scene – infamously scolded by Joss Whedon months before *World*'s release – somewhat stomachable.

The supporting cast brings a lot to the table. Coming straight from making Wilson Fisk darkly enchanting in Netflix's *Daredevil*, D'Onofrio portrays warfaring Hoskins to perfection, joining Irrfan Khan's Simon Masrani in making *World* all the more immersive.

Park owner Masrani is invaluable in establishing the success of the theme park to date. His passion for the humility which the gargantuan lizards grant humanity provides an insight into how his park has survived so long where John Hammond's "because we can" venture crumbled before it even began.

The way Trevorrow's film establishes attitudes towards the first park – and specifically Hammond – is where the writing shines brightest. How exactly does the successful Jurassic World regard its starcrossed predecessor? In hushed tones, as a ghost story.

Hammond is honoured nonetheless for his contributions to the science, and Masrani speaks of the late doctor of paleontology as a fallen hero, but not without a hint of condemnation for the pioneer's hubris. There are other scattered nods to the original throughout the film, some more subtle than others, but *World* never goes full *Terminator* in aggrandisement of its own motifs.

We've also upgraded from off-screen deaths to laborious depictions of minor characters' demises. One particularly incruciating scene drags out a death for a good while longer than is strictly necessary. It's apparent that what is acceptable to show children in the cinema has vastly shifted since release of *Park*, which after all predates the original PlayStation by over a year. Video games in the past 22 years have pushed so far the boundaries of on-screen violence that what was once reserved for horror films can now find itself in a family adventure.

A lot of the film makes no sense, but I applaud it for doing so in the most obvious way. Michael Crichton's entire premise is bogus, but the first film spent so long sneaking jargon and explanations of the science into the script that an overwhelmingly high proportion of people expected the park to be realised in the near future. *World*, thankfully, does away with all that misplaced realism. There are dinosaurs in a theme park and rather than reinforce the balderdash, *World* just steamrolls ahead with consequence. Again, it's the '80s thing to do: repeat "flux capacitor" or insist you had to be naked, but don't bother with half an hour of *Source Code*-style justification.

Overall, *World* is an enjoyable flick, more akin to a rollercoaster ride than a stroll through a nature reserve. Life finding a way is not the focus here at all. It's an unapologetic adrenaline-ride with enough humour to avoid ennui. For spectacle and feeling like a nine-year-old, *Jurassic World* is perfect.
