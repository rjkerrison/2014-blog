I've always loved a Sunday roast. Growing up, the highlight of my week was forever a large helping of roast meat with a lot of mashed potato,
soaked in gravy and topped with vegetables and Yorkshire puddings.

My family and I would sit around our dining room table just that once per week.
My dad would crack the terrible jokes which now form a large part of my repertoire.
My mum would tut and Daniel and I would laugh.
During my remembered "Golden Era" of Sunday dinners, Charlotte was a vegetarian.
Georgia hated peas â€“ and still does.
Owen must have been younger than five at that time, being ever more verbose every week.
This is all nearing on ten years ago now,
but the smell of mashed potato and roast chicken still invokes that medley of childhood memories.

I've no idea where it came from,
but the smell of roast meat wafted into the room where my girlfriend and I were in bed this morning
and I figured I needed to find a place that did a good roast.
After a little scrolling through TripAdvisor and ransacking my mind palace for three years of Leamington gastropub recommendations,
I decided we'd chase down the mythical White Horse Inn.

The pub itself lies adjacent to its own courtyard that acts as a thoroughfare between Clarendon Street and Covent Garden,
just moments from the northernmost end of the Parade.
