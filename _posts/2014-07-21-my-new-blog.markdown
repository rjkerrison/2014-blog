<p class="lead">
I've been meaning to start up a blog for ages. I've previously used the usual services like Wordpress and Blogspot, but find them both largely cumbersome in their management and difficult to customise. They also restrict the freedom of content. I knew I'd be able to find a better way: this is it.
