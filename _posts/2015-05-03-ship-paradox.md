My main problem with the past is that of the ship paradox or, as an Only Fools fan will know it, "this old broom."

Greek philosopher Plutarch's thought experiment was inspired by the ship which
Theseus sailed from Crete{% include ref.html text="This likely didn't happen." %}
and which the Athenians maintained for centuries hence, by replacing old planks as they decayed with fresh
ones.{% include ref.html text="This also likely didn't happen." %}
Plutarch posited that if one owns a ship and one replaces a component,
for example a single plank, then the resulting ship is the same ship, albeit with a minor modification.
One would still call it by the same name and by doing so be well understood.

The paradox arises in asking that if one replaces each component of the ship over a period of time,
with the resulting ship containing none of the original materials, then one has a completely different ship;
at what point did it stop being the original?

John Sullivan was a lot more succinct than Plutarch.

The issue here is that we as humans love to name things, to categorise them, to conceptualise them,
to define an ever-changing bundle as a static object.
This is none more apparent than if you consider that, at birth, you were a tiny
baby{% include ref.html text="Probably." %} and now you're a fully grown
adult.{% include ref.html text="For legal purposes, I assume my readers are all over 18." %}
Aside from your eyes, every bit of your anatomy is constantly being replaced;
your body parts at birth are not those which you have now, or even a part thereof.

Like a lot of things, this brings up a problem of identity, but today I'd like to focus on
something whose existence is even more dubious: the past.

For some reason, in English at the very least, we seem to be able to talk quite freely of a
time gone by as though it's a tangible snapshot.
In reality, even when you were living in it, the past was less definite than the state of Theseus's ship.
Everything is constantly changing.
There are ripples in the water, the sand is always drifting and the Earth doesn't stop spinning.

There can be such a sense of loss when something seemingly permanent, a comfort, is lost.
This tendency to name things, the tendency to label an arrangement of some wooden planks,
it giveth but it also taketh away.
Being able to rely on an entity, whether it be a family home, a job, a friend,
the price of a pint of Black Sheep down the local Wetherspoons, is a huge comfort.
There's a lot that falls way beyond our control and the idea that we can grab a few things
for ourselves and keep them in our caves is a huge help in an otherwise manic world.

<blockquote>Hoarding is the opium of the people.</blockquote>

Just as Trigger believes his broom to be the same broom he's had for the past 17 broomheads,
so do we build an awful lot on aspects of our life seeming constant.

Coping with a home comfort no longer being there is difficult,
but I think it helps to realise that the idealised golden era
– or the conceptualised version of an object – never truly existed.
It's pretty hard to miss something you know you never had.

There is no past as nothing is truly constant. Broom handles are being replaced all the time.
