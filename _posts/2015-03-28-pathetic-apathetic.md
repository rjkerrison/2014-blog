Democracy in Britain is crap.

If you'd like some evidence on this front, watch Prime Minister's Questions and attempt to take it seriously.
Count the number of national referenda in the past 30 years.
See if you can get a decent reason out of a workman in a Labour stronghold as to why he votes red beyond "bloody Tories."
Name a party policy. Any party. Any policy on anything.
You've likely either you've gone for Labour's unworkable vote-winner about frozen gas prices or UKIP's short-sighted keep-em-all-out.

My number one complaint about Westminster's irrelevance is that my demographic is not in its target audience.
I'm not aged, retired, on a zero-hour contract or starting a family, which means I'm not in anybody's manifesto, not even as a footnote.
It seems strange since arguably it's young professionals who stoke the fires of Britain's engine by paying taxes, by promoting growth by plugging
the few gaps in the job market to GDP and by using as near as makes no difference to zero public resources.

I was fortunate enough to avoid George and Vince's student fees hike and I've somehow found a place to live in London for under Â£1000 per month.
Pretty lucky on all fronts, but I can't help but notice that my generation has been utterly shafted.
Stiffed with funding an unsustainable property boom without being a part of it, supporting an overabundance of pensions and
balancing the tax breaks granted to those who decide to fuel overpopulation,
single childless professional twenty-somethings pretty much have the raw end of the deal.

It's not hard, then, to see why there's so much apathy going around.
After all, apathy is tax-free and legal but still rebellious, making it a perfect tonic to being politically and financially kicked in the groin.
"Don't care what I think? Well, I won't tell you then," might sound like an idiotic sentiment,
but it's nonetheless a large part of the fabric of my generation's political views.

Sadly, however, this attitude has a sting in its tail: not voting en masse destroys a demographic's political capital.
If I'm in charge of a small taskforce and things are getting tough, I'll put the burden on those who won't complain.
Anyone who won't pipe up in an upcoming company-wide game of "who's firing is it anyway?"
is going to take the brunt of the storm; it's those whose voices are heard whose happiness concerns me most.

I'd rather not suggest some kind of uprising or advocate tribalism amongst Britain's varied population,
but I've heard "hard-working families" an awful lot these past five years;
"struggling graduates" seems to be absent from the electoral campaign lexicon.

To change that, I'm voting.
It matters little for whom I vote: what matters is that I'm counted.
What matters is that young people aren't the casualty of the next 5 budgets
simply because the Chancellor knows he's only upsetting apathetics.

Britain has long been ruled by an overnumerous generation who took whatever they wanted and I hope mine can be better than that,
but I'm certainly not going to stand in line for oppression by not standing in line for the ballot box.

The Liberal Democrats amassed a number of seats thanks to people outside the traditional Conservative and Labour pigeonholes,
but immediately sold their souls for a shot at the big-time.
