summary: Why are migrants in Calais less human than Cecil?
---
I'm not entirely sure how it happened,
maybe it was by shouting loudest,
but Nigel Farage has established himself at the forefront of the narrative on migrants,
many of whom are refugees of war,
stationed at Calais and attempting to gain access to Britain via the Channel Tunnel.
Farage has been very quick to completely dismiss any suggestion that the people in Calais are people.
Meanwhile, an idiot dentist in the US is being targeted by unfiltered hatred for the killing of a wild animal.
The two occurences might not seem related at first glance, but there is a relation between them which is somewhat telling.

Our egregious Prime Minister Mr David Cameron has followed suit in dehumanising thousands of victims of conflict,
either through an absence of humanity or fear that his party could lose support from *Mail*-ites if he's seen to have a "light touch,"
His insults and threats thus far have been to use the collective noun for insects and to deny human beings any kind of humanitarian support
from a nation of incredible wealth.
In stark contrast to an unfeeling treatment of people, Mr Cameron has been quick to [pledge to save wildlife](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/30/david-cameron-promises-protect-wildlife-cecil-the-lion-killing) following the death of a lion.

The media at large has been very careful to throw around the cacophemism "migrants" as much as possible.
The M-word's negative connotations are so often reinforced by sensationalist journalism and figures like Farage
that they've begun creating an institutional hatred for anyone who can so be described.
It rings of a mid-20th Century American screaming "communist" with unapologetically ignorant disdain.

Why the lack of compassion for those in Calais in such desperate need?
I can't begin to comprehend the level of fear that would drive a person across the Mediterranean
and up through the whole of Europe without food, shelter or any aid along the way.
Are they really chasing the greener pastures of the UK?
They must have missed the memo about the current government and its hatred of anything foreign, fun or uneconomical.

In the midst of all this blind-eye-turning,
why is there worldwide compassion for a wild beast that would, given the chance, rip off your face and eat it for dinner?

First of all, the *Lion King* is a lot more popular than
the most popular animated film about migrants fleeing oppressive regimes and terrorism,
which I guess is probably *The Prince of Egypt*.

Second of all, that lion had a name.
The mothers, fathers, sons and daughters in Calais don't.

That dentist was definitely off his rocker and Cecil the lion was in no way harming anyone.
I've literally no idea what his motivation could have been,
save for "something something penis something."

The two thousand people in Calais were harming no-one when they fled from terrorists.
I have no idea what the motivation of murderers hunting humans under the ISIS flag could be,
save for "something something religion something."

I'm incredibly lucky to live in Britain.
I did nothing to earn this status,
save for being descended by similarly lucky people,
some of whom might have been involved
in conquering parts of Africa, Asia, the Americas and Oceania.

This country has such a chequered, violent history of throwing its weight around the globe.
In such a way, Britain murdered natives in India, Indiana, the West Indies
and a bunch of other misnamed lands.
In a joint effort with the rest of Europe,
the British brought racial hatred to sub-Saharan Africa.

While it's not necessarily by Britain's failing that the Middle East and North Africa
is as war-torn as it is,
it and its former colony the United States definitely made mistakes during the Cold War
whose consequences are very much still unravelling.
Proxy wars ripped the region apart in a modernised homage to the crusades.
The US provided money and weapons to the mujahideen resistance in the Soviet-Afghan war,
with Osama bin Laden notably among them.
Instability in the region has seen a rise in the terrorist group ISIS,
which is now terrifyingly severe and faceless.

Now we have several thousand people understandably terrified of being sent back
to the warzones of Egypt, Tunisia, Syria et al.
Britain's response? "Fuck off," basically.

Why? Where's the compassion? These are people, Mr Cameron, not insects.
Are any of them asking for benefits? No, they're not. They're asking for shelter.
Give them the right to work in Britain, find them a job,
let them fend for themselves in a country where that won't lead
to a beheading from an imbecile fanatic who completely misinterpreted the Qur'an.

If the problem with the migrants is that they're illegally entering the country,
bloody well figure out a way to let them enter legally.
Figure out a way to protect the people of this world â€“
the same world we so callously abused in centuries past.

Britain really did believe that any piece of land on which it planted a flag was its kingdom,
claiming everything the light touches and presumably neglecting a few elephant graveyards.
Fast-forward a few hundred years,
and the latest leader of these isles, Mr David Cameron,
is banishing starving, scared migrants to lands still ruled by whoever has the biggest gun and least remorse.

If we have it in us to get protective over the late lion Cecil,
surely we can't watch fellow humans suffering at the hands of fanaticals.
We're a tiny nation who somehow trashed this planet completely.
We're supposed to be sophisticated now; it's time we made amends.
