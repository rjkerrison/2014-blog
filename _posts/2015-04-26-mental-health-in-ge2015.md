Attitudes around mental health have shifted a lot in the last decade.
It's now an issue at the forefront of the agendas for all but the two largest parties,
whose manifestos seem all the more concerned with economic policies than the mental wellbeing of the UK population.

My following handy guide offers a brief summary of how each of the UK's seven largest political parties
describe mental health and their commitment to it in their General Election 2015 manifestos.

## Conservatives

The Conservative Party have pledged, like many others,
to treat mental health as equal to physical health.
They've not been so verbose as some of the smaller parties,
nor have they offered any concrete numbers on waiting lists or spending.
However, there are a number of qualitative commitments laid down in their manifesto.

## Labour

The Labour party's manifesto mentions mental health on three occasions.
The first is in a sensationalist tirade about the importance of the NHS;
the second is a whole paragraph promising that mental health will have parity with
physical health in a Labour-driven NHS;
the third is a reassertion of the same promise in a summary of the manifesto.

## Liberal Democrats
The Liberal Democrats are the only party to have released a supplementary manifesto
dedicated to their stance on mental health ahead of 7<sup>th</sup> May.

## Green Party

The Green Party are very vocal on the issue of mental health,
which is reflected in the care with which they discuss their
mandate not only to increase funding for mental health, but
to change the culture within which mental health is considered
differently and subordinately to physical health.

## Scottish National Party

Nothing here yet.

## UK Independence Party

Refreshingly sensible promises, but vague enough not to mean all that much and negated by the denial of treatment for anyone who isn't quite British enough.

## Plaid Cymru
