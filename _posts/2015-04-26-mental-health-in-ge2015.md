summary: A look at how the major parties' manifestos discuss mental health.
---
Attitudes around mental health have shifted a lot in the last decade.
It's now an issue at the forefront of the agendas for all but the two largest parties,
whose manifestos seem all the more concerned with economic policies than the mental wellbeing of the UK population.

Of all the parties, the Liberal Democrats are the most verbose on the issue, followed by the Green Party.
Both have sensible plans for reforms and give mental health the priority it needs,
not just within the health service but within government and society as well.

My following handy guide offers a summary of how each of the UK's seven largest political parties
describe mental health and their commitment to it in their General Election 2015 manifestos.

## Conservatives

The Conservative Party have pledged, like many others,
to treat mental health as equal to physical health.
They've not been so verbose as some of the smaller parties,
nor have they offered any concrete numbers on waiting lists or spending.
However, there are a number of qualitative commitments laid down in their manifesto.

## Labour

The Labour party's manifesto mentions mental health on three occasions.
The first is in a sensationalist tirade about the importance of the NHS;
the second is a whole paragraph promising that mental health will have parity with
physical health in a Labour-driven NHS;
the third is a reassertion of the same promise in a summary of the manifesto.

## Liberal Democrats
The Liberal Democrats are the only party to have released a supplementary manifesto
dedicated to their stance on mental health ahead of 7<sup>th</sup> May.

They cover the issue more than anyone and are only outpaced by Green on their use of numbers and on one or two minor points.

## Green Party

The Green Party are very vocal on the issue of mental health,
which is reflected in the care with which they discuss their
mandate not only to increase funding for mental health, but
to change the culture within which mental health is considered
differently and subordinately to physical health.

## UK Independence Party

UKIP make refreshingly sensible promises, but they're vague enough not to mean all that much.
Also, everything they say on health is negated by the denial of treatment for anyone who isn't yet five-years a Brit.

## Scottish National Party

The SNP will seek to increase Holyrood's mental health innovation fund from £15 million to £100 million over the next five years.
They'll also review the conditionality and sanctions regime, in particular looking at how it affects those with mental health conditions.

Here's everything else they said in their manifesto on mental health in full:

<blockquote>Resources will be
directed towards projects that will improve mental
health treatments in the primary care sector. The fund
will also enable further investment in child and
adolescent mental health services. Scotland was the first
country in the UK to introduce waiting time targets for
these services, and we have increased the workforce by
45 per cent.</blockquote>

## Plaid Cymru

They'll also raise awareness as a first step towards improving mental health in Wales.
They also want to tackle mental health in Wales' prisons to help prevent related reoffending.

Also on improving mental health at large,

<blockquote>Plaid Cymru will increase access
to talking therapies, as well
as funding support for eating
disorders, and drug and alcohol
treatment. We will also increase
resources for mental health
services for young people in
Wales.</blockquote>
