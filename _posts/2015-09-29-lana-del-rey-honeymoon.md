Way back in 2012, both _Born To Die_ and its overflow _Paradise_ established a sound for ethereal chantress Lana Del Rey.
Two years later, _Ultraviolence_ took no prisoners:
'West Coast' was the most intricate chart-topper from Lana to date
and 'Fucked My Way Up To The Top' revealed a dark sense of humour from the American artist.

Lana's latest, _Honeymoon_, showcases her talent for creating hooks of great subtlety.
The cinematic opener 'Honeymoon' flirts with a motif made famous by John Barry,
though not nearly as much as Lana's actual audition for the Bond theme song, '24',
which appears as _Honeymoon_'s track 12.

Unlike Sam Smith's poorly constructed 'Writing's On The Wall' which has about the
same emotional investment and climactic satisfaction of a half-finished wank,
'24' is an immensely strong candidate for a Bond theme.
It's impossible to hear the song without picturing an accompanying title sequence
featuring silhouettes of Daniel Craig and Christoph Waltz drifting in and out of a kaleidoscope of dinner jackets and Walthers.

More cinematic offerings are strewn throughout the album.
There's no doubt about the _Kill Bill_ vibe of 'God Knows I Tried'.
It'd slot nicely into _Django Unchained_, too.
The 4-note broken chord that marches up and down an acoustic guitar throughout screams gritty western.
It's a Simone-esque plea for forgiveness, akin to 'Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood',
a cover of which closes the album.

That finale for _Honeymoon_ seems at first out of place, but fits perfectly.
Don't let me be misunderstood, 'Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood' is one of my most favourite songs of all time.
Its lyrical simplicity, its heartfelt appeal, that bloody haunting riff: it's all so beautiful.
The Santa Esmerelda version which actually did feature on _Kill Bill_ was a fitting addition to the soundtrack.
Seeing it at the bottom of the track listing for _Honeymoon_ was a pretty big deal for me.
The only time I can remember being this excited about a cover version was with London Grammar's 'Nightcall';
I made some pretty horrific contortions upon first hearing it.
I was cohosting a student radio show at the time and
I'm still not sure what my cohost Hannah thought was happening.

My first listen to _Honeymoon_'s aforementioned closing cover was gladly in isolation,
so I was permitted any variety of involuntary appreciation.
Hairs stood on end for sure and I'd be surprised if I didn't close my eyes and relax into a euphoric stupor.
The track marries Lana's silky vocals with Horace Ott's lyrics to create another original take on the much-covered classic.
Harpsicords, xylophones and a string quartet: it's a high-concept arrangement that matches up to Lana's vocals and rounds off the album well.

Elsewhere, there's more of a mainstream appeal present,
none more so than in lead single 'Music To Watch Boys To'.
Its breathy opening line – _"I like you a lot"_ –
drops it into the best part of five minutes of seductive psychedelia.
The likelihood of it sustaining a popularity on the level of 'Summertime Sadness' and 'Blue Jeans'
is pretty darned high.
Great hooks and a certain tenacity to the lyrics sell it through to the quite frankly blissful chorus.

The next track and fellow promotional single 'Terrence Loves You' is pure ballad.
It reads like the ramblings of someone attempting to finish a thought while drowning,
like James Joyce rewrote _Finnegans Wake_ in the voice of a lovestruck musician
whose mind eventually breaks down into Bowie lyrics.

<blockquote>Ground control to Major Tom, can you hear me all night long?</blockquote>

It's bizarre but brilliant, although if I ever find it appropriate listening for a honeymoon,
I'll wonder quite whether I've made the right decision.
The same could probably be said for the whole album.

'High By The Beach' is the only explicit contribution this time around,
down on the four from _Ultraviolence_,
which was fittingly a much more violent offering than the oft serene _Honeymoon_.
If anything on _Honeymoon_ fits on the former album, it's this.
There's an anger to it which is otherwise absent from the record.

'Art Deco' could be either an admiration or a criticism of its subject, an amoral partygoer.

<blockquote>You're so Art Deco, out on the floor.
Shining like gun metal, cold and unsure.
Baby you're so ghetto, you're looking to score.
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them,
'cause you want more.
</blockquote>

Where the chorus is cutting, questioning our lively protagonist, the verses are somewhat more in cahoots with the lifestyle
being allegorically lampooned here.
Between its title and the devil-may-care attitude depicted in its lyrics,
making a connection to _The Great Gatsby_ is hardly a leap at all,
not least in the "gun metal" line.

We follow that allusion with something decidedly more David Lynch.
A minute and a half of spoken word, 'Burnt Norton' sounds like a message sent to Agent Cooper in a fever dream.
Calling it the 'Fitter Happier' of _Honeymoon_ would be a discredit to just how batshit 'Burnt Norton' is.

With 'Religion', we're back to the mainstream hits Lana can brew up so well.
'Salvatore' doesn't quite conform to this direction,
reverting back to the cinematic sensations left behind at 'God Knows I Tried'.

'The Blackest Day' would make quite the closing track.
It's a wind-down,
pleasantly meandering through everything quintessentially Lana Del Rey over six minutes.
It tails off gorgeously, befitting the infinite 1.8-second loop of static and wop of a finished record.
It's at this point, however, that we delve into the aforementioned perfect Bond song, '24'.

'Swan Song' is thus an odd addition; something of an afterthought perhaps.
From '24' onwards, we're not so much in the album as we are in the bonus tracks
– a distinction which doesn't detract from the tracks themselves.
Like '24', 'Swan Song' could comfortably fit into a title sequence for a spy caper.
Its eerie echoes, humming violins and disorientingly soothing synthetic organs
all add up to a step back towards the ethereal and into the shadows.

Clocking in at just over 65 minutes, _Honeymoon_ is pushing towards double-album territory,
but doesn't suffer for it.
Not one entry on its 14-strong listing seems superfluous;
on the whole, this fourth studio album
justifies Lana Del Rey's musical prowess as lasting far beyond the honeymoon stage.
