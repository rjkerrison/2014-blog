One of my most eternal grumbles is, well, let's have some example headlines:

<blockquote>Young fathers more likely to pass on genetic flaws</blockquote>

<blockquote>Trans people four times more likely to live in poverty</blockquote>

<blockquote>Journalists more likely to misreport statistics</blockquote>

Now let's imagine Timmy.
He's 12 years old and his high school teacher has just explained that the probability of a coin coming up heads when flipped is &#189;.
Being just old enough to know not to take adults at their word, Timmy decides to check this assertion by flipping a coin 100 times.

The probability of Timmy landing exactly 50 heads is minute, about a 7.9% chance, but that won't stop journalists from running the following headline when he lands 51 or more heads, which will happen 46% of the time.

<blockquote>Coins more likely to come up heads</blockquote>

There's just so much wrong with this.
First of all, the assumption that all coins are the same as the coin used by Timmy is clearly bogus.
For this reason, Timmy might bother flipping three coins 100 times each,
in which case he's still got a 9.7% chance of "disproving" the teacher by continuously landing 51 or more heads,
as well as a symmetrical 9.7% chance of landing 51 or more tails.
All in all then, with a perfectly balanced coin,{% include ref.html text="There's no such thing." %}
Timmy is still more likely to get the same bias indication thrice than to get a perfect 50/50 once. <span style="color: red;">wrong/misleading</span>

The problem is basically that correlation doesn't imply causation.<span style="color: red;">actually, we're not talking about that right now</style>.

It is the treachery of this closing clause which leads to problems. Bias dictates everything we do.
You might well enjoy *Love Actually* but for your experience that you dislike romcoms;
you might believe a Tory government would deliver the best future for Britain had your grandfather's mine not closed under Thatcher.

This is a vital survival tactic.
In its most basic form, bias is the result of conditioning, the most primitive form of learning or adaptation.
Nigh all creatures exhibit the ability to recall that something caused them pain in the past and to avoid it.
That's a far reach to 




in the same way a cat wields the mystical red laser dot that runs along the skirting boards.
