"I'll take the bigger half," says the greedier of two siblings, pulling rank on their junior, failing to notice the oxymoron.

It's almost universally understood that 7 out of 10 people are below average in their ability to report statistics.
{% include ref.html ref="1" text="This makes no sense, unless we're using \"average\" to mean \"mean\" and we have a positive skew." %}
Sadly, journalists exercise their right to wield statistics like an American exercises his right to bear arms.

My high school physics teacher had a saying, which I believe he stole from another teacher:

<blockquote>A bad scientist uses statistics like a drunk uses a lamppost: not for illumination, but for support.</blockquote>

It is the treachery of this closing clause which leads to problems. Bias dictates everything we do.
You might well enjoy *Love Actually* but for your experience that you dislike romcoms;
you might believe a Tory government would deliver the best future for Britain had your grandfather's mine not closed under Thatcher.

This is a vital survival tactic.
In its most basic form, bias is the result of conditioning, the most primitive form of learning or adaptation.
Nigh all creatures exhibit the ability to recall that something caused them pain in the past and to avoid it.
That's a far reach to 




in the same way a cat wields the mystical red laser dot that runs along the skirting boards.
