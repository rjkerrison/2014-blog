What is politics?

At it's core, the word *&quot;politics&quot;* is simply a derivation from the Greek &quot;politikos&quot; – *πολιτικός* for alphabet lovers – itself derived from the ever abundant Greek root *&quot;polis&quot;* meaning *&quot;city&quot;*.
Politics, then, is all about citizens.

Politics is in everything, in that anything people do is a choice n interaction with other people.

When we speak of politics, however,
we usually mean anything that people do to gain power over others and what they do with that power on behalf of those others.
Ideally on their behalf, at least.

I find it fairly important to know what people with power are doing and why.
I want to know who to trust to represent me and I like to know about my rights and liberties.
I want everybody to share those liberties, and I feel like the world at large is becoming a freer place every day,
though there's still a lot of room for improvement.

On occasions, I write about politics. Take a looksy at some of the things I've said, if you like.

Moreso than with any of the other subjects on which I write on this site,
I'd like to know what you think: do leave a comment if you've something to add to the discussion.
