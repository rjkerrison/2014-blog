Health is arguably the most important thing there is, because without it, there isn't anything else. To put it darkly.

The human body is pretty incredible and it's important not to take it for granted.
It's also important to look out for one another's health, which is why so many people work in health and social care.

I'm pretty sure you already know about health, however.

Feel free to read an article or two, or several. Or make an avacado salad, whatever.
