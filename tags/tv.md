# Television

In 1934, John Logie Baird cracked open a projector and a wireless and made some kind of Frankenbaby out of them,
which much to the annoyance of classicists and linguists we call *television* to this day.

While the transport industry mellowed after its innovative height of the 19th century
to make its many designs more reliable, more efficient, faster and steadily less life-threatening,
it was telecommunication's turn to go inventively apeshit.

Yeah, telegrams, telephones, the press and the postal system were well established by 1900,
but they were all just a little discriminatory about their recipients;
the 20th century was all about finding ways to say the same thing to *n'importe qui*.

Not content with broadcasting news or opinions matter-of-factly,
the new medium found all new ways to take ideas and thread them
through fictions with a subtlety ranging from that of the toothpick to that of the sledgehammer.

The 21st century is to television what the 20th was to auto- and locomotion:
a time for perfection and detail.
*Arrested Development*, *Breaking Bad* and *The Wire* could hardly have existed before the new millenium;
they're TV's TGV and McLaren F1.
