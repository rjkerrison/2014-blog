In a rather startling turn of events, a lot of my posts on this blog are about the blog itself, or blogging in general.

In fact, the whole blog was born out of an attempt to create a blog from scratch. It uses [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com "Jekyllrb.com"), which is a blog-aware static site generator. It uses [Markdown](//daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [Liquid](//github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) to create a static website from fairly basic building blocks.

My blog's source code can be found on [GitHub](//github.com/rjkerrison/rjkerrison.github.io "rjkerrison.github.io").
