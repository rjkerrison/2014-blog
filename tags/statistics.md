# Statistics

The more time progresses, the more people specialise; look at sport, where once the top tennis trophy was
competed by the Renshaws of Leamington Spa who turned up to Wimbledon prepared only by their playing
on their family estate.
Now, tennis is dominated by professionals who have honed only their tennis skills and forsaken any
skills outside that sporting sphere.
Politicians were once volunteers; now, they study politics as an art by necessity to compete
with their fellow politicians, but sadly this leaves them all far from rounded individuals
and thus a little out of touch with the population at large.

This curse of specialism dictates that people with the prolific experience necessary to become reporters or journalists
didn't have much time while learning their craft for a class on statistics.
As such, data are{% include ref.html text="one datum, many data" %} often misreported, misinterpreted or miscommunicated
by the press &ndash; I hope mostly by error than by design, though the latter is indupitably the case for
[certain publications with a blatant disregard for journalism](http://dailymail.co.uk/ "Daily Mail").

Whether deliberate or not, it's worthwhile to highlight some of the more dangerously reported statistics.

In the modern age of inexhaustible streams of information, judging the sound from the noise is more important than ever.
